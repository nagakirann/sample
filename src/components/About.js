      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Nagakiran Nelikanti, a passionate web developer. I specialize in creating dynamic and user-friendly websites using the latest web technologies. With experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Python, SQL, Git, and SDLC, I strive to bring innovative and practical solutions to every project I work on.

In addition to my web development skills, I have earned certificates and worked on projects such as the Todos Application, a task management tool with CRUD operations that lets users track and organize their to-do lists. This project highlights my proficiency in using JavaScript DOM operations, local storage, and dynamic UI updates.

Feel free to browse my portfolio to learn more about my projects and skills. You can also connect with me through email or social media links below.</p>
